valid arguments:
    --config - setup the client for use. Running this will re-run the entire login process and overwrite any previous
               config.
    --run - run the client. This will check for an existing config file and prompt for one until it exists. Ctrl+C will
            get you out.
    --daemon - once you're happy with the config, use this to launch a daemon that you don't have to worry about. Not
                a horrible idea to use it in a startup script.
